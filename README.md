# About
While travelling is on hold due to COVID-19, ‘50 State Voyage’ is an application that allows you to track states you’ve been to and plan out visits to states you’ll visit sometime in the future.

You can also share some of your favorite places with friends and bounce ideas with each other for your respective trips!
